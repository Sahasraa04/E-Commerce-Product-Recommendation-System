# E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System

A machine-learning based system that analyzes customer behavior, order history, and product performance to recommend relevant products and improve e-commerce profitability.


🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a data-driven **Product Recommendation System** for an e-commerce platform.
Using customer purchase history, product details, and behavior patterns, the system generates personalized recommendations while also analyzing overall business performance.

The system aims to:

* Improve customer experience
* Increase conversion rates
* Boost overall profitability
* Provide insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 🧮 Recommendation Techniques Used

### **🔹 Content-Based Filtering**

Recommends products similar to what the user has already viewed or purchased.

### **🔹 Collaborative Filtering**

Finds similar users and recommends products they liked.

### **🔹 Hybrid Model**

Combines both for more accurate results.
